Shutdown Raspberry Pi using HTTP REST API

This project is intended to shutdown a Headless Raspberry Pi device gracefully. For this purpose, I intend to run an HTTP REST server in the pi. This server would have a method to shutdown the device. There are several free Android apps that would simply call any HTTP REST API using a widget. 

I intend to write the code in Python 2.7.
